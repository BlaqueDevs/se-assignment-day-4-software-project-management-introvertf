# SE_DAY4_Software-Project-Management
## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?
  Timely delivery is crucial because  it ensures that the proect meets its objectives within the agreed timeframe. This ensures no delay that can increase costs.
  Managers can ensure that deadlines are met by:
  ~creating project plans with every single detail about the project with clear     milestones and deadlines.
  ~by regurlay monitoring the progress.
  ~by effective communication with the team and stakeholders.
  ~by using project management tools.
  ~by also identfying weaknesses and fixing them.
  
## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
  Effective cost control ensures that the project doesn't go beyond the budget that has been planned for that particular project. This helps to avoid potential financial issues that can cause the project to lag behin schedule.
  Some of the ways that can be used to prevent budget overruns are:
~Accurate estimations. This is done by using historical data and industry benchmarking to make accurate cost estimates.
~By developing a detailed project plan that includes  all tasks,milestones and timeframe so that you can avoid any extra costs.
~Also by implementing regular cost monitoring and reporting allowa you to know how much money has been used and how much is remaining.
~Using proeject management software to provide realtime updates on budget status.
~Maintaining open and honest communication wth all project stakeholders. This ensurea that the project team and the stakeholders are aware of the budget constraints and their role in cost control.
~Assing the right people to the right tasks to avoid misuse of funds. The right person for the job has experience on that filed and knows how to easier and methods to get the work done.

Flexibility-Agile's is higly flexible while waterfall is not that flexible.
Customer Involvement- its contionous on agile while its limited on waterfall methodology.
Documentation-Agiles's documentation is minimal and it majorly focuses on working software while waterfall's documentation is comprehesive.
